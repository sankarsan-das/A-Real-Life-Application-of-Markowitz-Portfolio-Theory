# A-Real-Life-Application-of-Markowitz-Portfolio-Theory
This project explores the application of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), also known as mean-variance analysis, as developed by Harry Markowitz, to the construction and analysis of investment portfolios. The core objective is to establish a mathematical framework for optimizing a portfolio by maximizing expected returns for a given level of risk, or conversely, minimizing risk for a targeted return.

The methodology involves a detailed examination of quadratic programming problems and their solutions using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which form the bedrock of portfolio optimization under MPT. Key concepts such as expected returns, portfolio variance as a measure of risk, and the minimization of risk for an acceptable baseline return are rigorously defined and explored. The project further investigates the derivation and characteristics of the efficient frontier, a hyperbolic curve representing the set of all efficient portfolios. Additionally, the impact of incorporating a risk-free asset into the portfolio is analyzed, leading to the development of the Capital Market Line and its implications for the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

For empirical analysis, the project utilizes historical stock data for Samsung Electronics (05930.KS), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Lenovo Group (0992.HK) and Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) from 15 June 2020 to 15 June 2025. This historical data is used to calculate individual asset returns, determine appropriate risk-free rates specific to each stock's primary trading market (South Korea, United States, and Hong Kong), and compute historical market returns ($\mu_M$) for the relevant indices (KOSPI, S\&P 500, Hang Seng Index). The ultimate aim is to apply these theoretical constructs to real-world stock data, demonstrating how MPT can guide strategic investment decisions by balancing risk and return.
